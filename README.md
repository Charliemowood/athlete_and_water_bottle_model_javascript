This is a piece of code that I expanded on. We did the water functionality in class. The athlete needed to have the following functionality. 

* Create and test a constructor for athlete objects.
* Athlete should have a hydration attribute that starts at 100.
* Athlete should have a distance covered attribute starts at 0.
* Athlete should be able to run: increasing distance, decreasing hydration.
* Athlete should not move when running dehydrated: hydration at 0;
* Athlete should be able to increae hydration by drinking from water bottle

To get the project working on your environment. Run the following:

```npm install```
